# Feature flags

We’d like you to create a feature flag service using Spring in Java.<br>
Take no more than 2 hours to do this (however, we won’t check!).

Here are the requirements for this service:

- As an admin user, I want to be able to create a feature which defaults to disabled
- As an admin user, I want to be able to switch on a feature for a user
- As a user, I want to be able to get all the enabled features (a mix of all the globally enabled
ones and the ones enabled just for my user)

Some notes:

This is deliberately open-ended - you can focus this service on backend clients or mobile
clients, include security or not include it, but we’ll expect you to explain why and how you’ve
chosen to do it.

Use https://start.spring.io and choose gradle - otherwise there are no other restrictions in the
technologies you use.

Work your way through the features in the time frame, as you would if this was given to you
at work. In the face to face, we can talk about what else would need to be added before
pushing it to production.

We will also ask you to add to the code during the face to face interview.

Once you’re done, push it to github and send us the link

We are not assessing you on:
Your knowledge of Spring - feel free to google what you need<br>
What technologies you use - anything that you can justify well is good

What we’re assessing you on:
- Understanding of REST and API design
- Testing
- Understanding how clients integrate with this service
- Simplicity
